# MeFitExperis
This is a project conducted the final stages of the Experis Acadamy program 2022. A case was assigned to us (Sara SÃ¶derberg, Robin E. Hellgren and Robin T. Hellgren) consisting of a fitness tracking app. The app should allow the user to create and track fitness goals that consist of specific workouts. The application was created using React, .NET, SQL Server and deployed on Azure. A link to the live version can be found below. More documentation can be found in our  [wiki](https://github.com/RobinHellgren/MeFitExperis/wiki)
